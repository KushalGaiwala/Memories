- ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB (MERN Stack) Application after I learned React by making my first small App Adopt-Me.
- Used Redux for data channeling through whole react app when necessary with the help of constants, reducers, and actions.
### Frontend:
- Used Material-UI for buttons and Css used themes extension in it.
- Usability of React Components along with Redux-thunx to transmit data to components when needed.
- With the help of actions, reducers Redux was a great learning curve for me.

- Used NodeJS to handle the server side of the application.
- Along with ExpressJS as the middleware which handles the Restful-API requests and responses of the Application.
